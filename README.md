# Movie Reviews Classification
This project is a part of the Acamica Institute in Buenos Aires.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to classify movie reviews made by users. A potential use of this model is the processing of large datasets of movie reviews in order to get a better understanding of what users are saying about movies.

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* Data Cleaning
* Data Filtering
* Natural Language Processing

### Technologies
* Python
* Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, Scikit-learn

## Project Description
The objective is to classify movie reviews into two major groups: negative or positive. Natural Language Processing techniques will be used in order to process the movie reviews. Then, we'll use TfidfVecrorizer so we can transform the reviews into vectors. Then, those vectors will be used to train a Voting Classifier and get a prediction of positive or negative. By getting the amount of positive and negative reviews, we can analyse how many people are dissatisfied and why. A major challenge of this project is to correctly transform the reviews into useful vectors because of the nature of the reviews. Things like punctuation marks and slang need special attention.
